Hope I get to the payment day soon.",

Things were disappearing on my dashboard and not looking right. Customer service to the rescue. They hooked me up with everything I needed and then some! For the inconvenience, they went ahead and qualified my other $100k fast track evaluation that I met the $$ goal on last week but still last week had a day or 2 left to trade on it for the evaluation period. On top of that they gave some points on my account for the inconvenience. Nothing but exceptional experiences with this customer team! Their response time is second to none and their understanding and generosity and grace while working to resolve the issue is unbelievable! Thank you ETF!",

I reached out and ETF Customer Service had a solution to me quickly. They canceled the account I paid full value for, gave me a full refund, and then they gave me a new 1 time promo code for a new account to replace the canceled one. On top of that, I didn't use the code same day and it expired, when I reached out again, they gave me another one time code. Ultimately, I finally got my new EOD evaluation at the promo rate, even though they didn't have too because the promo had expired. Big thank you! It's also not the first time I have reached out to ETF Customer Support and every interaction has been the same, timely response and helpful.",
